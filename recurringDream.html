This dream startes out with me being in different world. and bare in mind this dream is very random.
The beginning of the story starts out with me being in a different world and I'm on my own. I work with a group of people who are trying to stop an evil force
Basically we're like the avengers but there's no Iron Man or Captain America which really sucks because I love them so much.
But anyway, back to the story, there's one specific part of the dream which I remember very clearly. I'm riding on a horse or very large motorcyle and I'm racing against this train which I'm trying to stop.
It's unclear of what is inside the train, but my thought is that it's very dangerous because that's what the movies say
To make this dream sound even cooler if that's even a word but, I work for a secret agency kinda like the avengers with working for Sheild.
I work with other people in my friend group and we all work together to save the planet and we all have our own individual powers. We all use our powers together to fight the most evil villians on the plant
We all care for each other and work together even when times are rough. Sometimes when life happens and you feel like giving up but we overcome our problems as a team.
Obviously this dream is all over the place and I hope it made sense.
